I have been teaching Meditation for many years and in many forms. Recently I trained as a Reiki practitioner. I have passed Level 2 and intend to take the Masters Level next year. I have found that using meditation with relaxation breathing helps the person to experience the benefit of the Reiki energy.

I follow the Japanese method of Reiki founded by Mikao Usui. It is said that the Western method of Reiki came from the Japanese. Usui set up a method of healing that had been used for centuries. He believed that breathing in the right way aids relaxation and with meditation is the key to the enhanced flow of Reiki. Reiki has manifest qualities. First it is a healing system but also will help the individual increase self awareness, insight and personal growth. Relaxation decreases anxiety and stress and lowers the blood pressure. After a session a person can feel energised and happy.

The application of Reiki is simple. the person lies on a bed and the practitioner places her hands on the recipient. The practitioner moves her hands slowly as she feels the energy flow. As she moves her hands she may be able to feel if there are any problems that are causing pain or anxiety. When she has finished she allows the recipient to wake up slowly until she feels ready to open her eyes.

So if anyone reading this feels that they would benefit from a session of Reiki then email me at: [susannetrevorrow.reiki@gmail.com](mailto:susannetrevorrow.reiki@gmail.com)

Best wishes Susanne Trevorrow.
